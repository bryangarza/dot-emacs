#+title: .emacs.d

This is my emacs config.

* Languages

I've configured it for the following languages:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Markdown
- Elisp
- Clojure
- Haskell
- OCaml
- C
- Jade
- Stylus
- Scheme
- Racket
- Scala
- Hy

Other languages may work out-of-the-box, for example I have not changed any
settings for Python but the default editing experience is decent as-is.

* Packages and Modes

Notable packages and modes that I use include

- Evil
- Paredit
- Helm, Helm Swoop
- Flycheck
- Multiple Cursors
- Ace Jump
